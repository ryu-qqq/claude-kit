  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  
  # Multi-AZ deployment
  az_count = 3
  
  # Auto Scaling configuration
  min_size = 2
  max_size = 10
  desired_capacity = 3
  
  # Database configuration
  db_engine = "aurora-postgresql"
  db_instance_class = "db.r6g.large"
  backup_retention_period = 30
  
  # Security settings
  enable_deletion_protection = true
  encryption_enabled = true
}
```

#### 2. Microservices Architecture
```terraform
# Request: "Design microservices infrastructure with ECS"
# Output: ECS-based microservices platform

module "microservices_platform" {
  source = "./modules/ecs-microservices"
  
  cluster_name = "microservices-cluster"
  
  services = {
    user_service = {
      cpu = 256
      memory = 512
      desired_count = 2
    }
    order_service = {
      cpu = 512
      memory = 1024
      desired_count = 3
    }
  }
  
  load_balancer_config = {
    enable_https = true
    certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.main.arn
  }
}
```

#### 3. Database-Heavy Application
```terraform
# Request: "Create infrastructure for data-intensive application"
# Output: Optimized database infrastructure

module "data_platform" {
  source = "./modules/data-infrastructure"
  
  # Primary database
  primary_db = {
    engine = "aurora-postgresql"
    instance_class = "db.r6g.2xlarge"
    storage_encrypted = true
  }
  
  # Read replicas
  read_replicas = 3
  
  # Caching layer
  elasticache_config = {
    node_type = "cache.r6g.large"
    num_cache_nodes = 3
  }
  
  # Data warehouse
  redshift_config = {
    node_type = "dc2.large"
    cluster_type = "multi-node"
    number_of_nodes = 3
  }
}
```

### cost-optimized-environment-manager Usage

      "spot_instance_percentage": 90,
      "auto_shutdown": True,
      "daily_cost_limit": 50
    }
  },
  
  "schedule": {
    "start_time": "09:00",  # 9 AM
    "stop_time": "19:00",   # 7 PM  
    "days": "MON-FRI",      # Weekdays only
    "timezone": "UTC"
  },
  
  "notifications": {
    "cost_alerts": True,
    "schedule_notifications": True,
    "slack_webhook": "your-webhook-url"
