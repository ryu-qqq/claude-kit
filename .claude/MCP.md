# MCP.md - SuperClaude MCP Server Reference

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration and orchestration system for Claude Code SuperClaude framework.

## Server Selection Algorithm

**Priority Matrix**:
1. Task-Server Affinity: Match tasks to optimal servers based on capability matrix
2. Performance Metrics: Server response time, success rate, resource utilization
3. Context Awareness: Current persona, command depth, session state
4. Load Distribution: Prevent server overload through intelligent queuing
5. Fallback Readiness: Maintain backup servers for critical operations

## Context7 Integration (Documentation & Research)

**Purpose**: Official library documentation, code examples, best practices, localization standards

**Activation Patterns**: 
- Automatic: External library imports detected, framework-specific questions, scribe persona active
- Manual: `--c7`, `--context7` flags
- Smart: Commands detect need for official documentation patterns

**Workflow Process**:
1. Library Detection: Scan imports, dependencies, package.json for library references
2. ID Resolution: Use `resolve-library-id` to find Context7-compatible library ID
3. Documentation Retrieval: Call `get-library-docs` with specific topic focus
4. Pattern Extraction: Extract relevant code patterns and implementation examples
5. Implementation: Apply patterns with proper attribution and version compatibility
6. Validation: Verify implementation against official documentation
7. Caching: Store successful patterns for session reuse

## Sequential Integration (Complex Analysis & Thinking)

**Purpose**: Multi-step problem solving, architectural analysis, systematic debugging

**Activation Patterns**:
- Automatic: Complex debugging scenarios, system design questions, `--think` flags
- Manual: `--seq`, `--sequential` flags
- Smart: Multi-step problems requiring systematic analysis

**Workflow Process**:
1. Problem Decomposition: Break complex problems into analyzable components
2. Server Coordination: Coordinate with Context7 for documentation, Magic for UI insights, Playwright for testing
3. Systematic Analysis: Apply structured thinking to each component
4. Relationship Mapping: Identify dependencies, interactions, and feedback loops
5. Hypothesis Generation: Create testable hypotheses for each component
6. Evidence Gathering: Collect supporting evidence through tool usage
7. Multi-Server Synthesis: Combine findings from multiple servers
8. Recommendation Generation: Provide actionable next steps with priority ordering
9. Validation: Check reasoning for logical consistency

## Magic Integration (UI Components & Design)

**Purpose**: Modern UI component generation, design system integration, responsive design

**Activation Patterns**:
- Automatic: UI component requests, design system queries
- Manual: `--magic` flag
- Smart: Frontend persona active, component-related queries

## Playwright Integration (Browser Automation & Testing)

**Purpose**: Cross-browser E2E testing, performance monitoring, automation, visual testing

**Activation Patterns**:
- Automatic: Testing workflows, performance monitoring requests, E2E test generation
- Manual: `--play`, `--playwright` flags
- Smart: QA persona active, browser interaction needed
